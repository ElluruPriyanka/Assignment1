#Website for Itzy(Kpop group)

This website's goal is to educate fans of the K-pop group(Itzy) about the background of the band as well as provide additional details about their favorite members. Additionally, people can use the websiteÂ to learn how to purchase tickets for the concerts of their favorite idol.The website also helps the fans to understand unique facts about their idols that they have never heard of before and this might be a good way for more people to find out about new idols.Most people know popular kpop groups like BTS and Blackpink but not many know about Itzy.Hence, i decided to make this website to promote their songs and their members so they can get more fame and popularity.

# Design Process

I wanted the background of my website to match the itzy theme, so I went with this design. I went with a straightforward and easy method to learn the names and biographies of my idols. This website is simple to use and gives users great insights into what they are looking for, such as Itzy's merchandise and perhaps their most well-known songs. I chose to use these colors because they are eye-catching and draw the reader in. It makes the photographs pop out and is pleasing to the eye. I believe that this website is appropriate for new fans who are interested in learning more about where to get the merchandise. I believe that many people are interested in learning more about Itzy's music and biography, which is why this
I believe that many fans want to learn more about Itzy's songs and personal life, thus this website is ideal for them because it offers useful details.

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process.

The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

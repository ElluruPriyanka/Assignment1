#Website for Itzy(Kpop group)

This website's goal is to educate fans of the K-pop group(Itzy) about the background of the band as well as provide additional information about their favorite members of the group. Additionally, people can use the websiteÂ to gather more pictures in the gallery tab and use them as a screen wallpaper.The loyal fans can find out about their members dislikes and likes.The website also helps the fans to understand unique facts about their idols that they have never heard of before and this might be a good way for more people to find out about new idols.Most people know popular kpop groups like BTS and Blackpink but not many know about Itzy.Therefore, i made a tab for the albums and people can see their music videos and also find some good songs to listen to.After listening to them, maybe they might decided to stand for them.Hence, i decided to make this website to promote their songs and their members so they can get more fame and popularity.

# Design Process

I wanted the background of my website to match the itzy theme, so I went with this design. I went with a straightforward and easy method to learn the names and biographies of my idols. This website is simple to use and gives users great insights into what they are looking for, such as Itzy's nice photo gallery and perhaps their most well-known songs. I chose to go with a black background and white words for a contrasting view that is pleaseing to the eyes and draws in the reader.There's many photos for the fans to save and also learn the faces of the members. I believe that this website is appropriate for new fans who are interested in learning more about the group and also find new songs to listen to. I believe that many people are interested in learning more about Itzy's music and profile.I believe that many fans want to learn more about Itzy's songs and personal life, thus this website is ideal for them because it offers useful details.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process.

# Existing Features

- A navigation bar at the side instead of at the top so that people can use it easily on phone and on website.

- The background of my homepage has some words that say "click here to watch the latest songs" to link it to the latest song released so that the fans won't miss out on the recent songs and support their band

- I created an automatic slideshow for my hommepage background cover in order to make it look pleasing to the eye

- I added instagram, youtube, twitter and spotify icons that links to the spotify , youtube, twitter and instagram accounts

- I have many videos embeded for the fans to see the music videos

- I have many pictures in a container at the side in order to give a clearer view of the songs and also their description

- I have a gallery where when you click an image, a bigger image will pop out

- For my profile page,i have added a tab where you can click to see the different profiles of each member

- When you hover over the image you can see the colour change when you change to a different tab

- For my disography page, there many different albums and i created a different page for each album so that fans can learn
  more about his or her favourite song

# Features Left to Implement

- I need to implement features like maybe creating forms for fans to fill up to go for events

# Another feature idea

- Maybe i can use a slideshow to show my image more clearly

Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

- My mobile view for my homepage website words well but just that there is a lot of empty spaces here and there so it doesnt really look that attractive.
- my other pages are not that good when presented in mobile view as the background cover gets distorted and doesnt fit the screen size like how i want it to be
- the icon placement is not standarised so it might look kinda messy
- the gallery view might be a hard to see the image if its too big

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

Other than this size, everything else is a mess.

Interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing:

- When i run my slideshow in Projects page i do not why the image will not load without pressing the next button
